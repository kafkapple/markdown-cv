## Currently

Independent Researcher
(Seeking Postdoctoral Position)

## Research Statement

My research aims to advance human-like general AI through neuro-cognitive principles of dynamic information processing, leveraging extensive knowledge and research experience in diverse fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience, coupled with intensive training and experience in AI project implementation. This unique interdisciplinary background positions me to develop principled, biologically-inspired, and human-like artificial general intelligence.

### Specialized in

### Research interests

1. Grid Processing \& Episodic-to-Semantic Memory Transformation:
- Investigate entorhinal-hippocampal grid-like encoding and hippocampal-cortical consolidation in converting episodic traces into abstract semantic schemas.

2. Reference Frames \& Multisensory Binding: 
- Investigate how multi-modal intersensory redundancy in infancy scaffolds working memory, theory of mind (ToM), and vocabulary, and whether fusiform face area (FFA) circuits serve as structuring frames for hierarchical quantization of continuous sensorimotor data.

### Core Competencies

1. Neuroscience–AI Convergence:
- Initiated and led 10+ Neureka \& KAIST NeuroAI seminar series, translating electrophysiology and behavioral insights into AI workflows.  

2. Experimental Neurobiology:
- Designed and executed 10+ genetic–behavioral and in vivo electrophysiology experiments; supported fMRI/EEG task setup and analysis of social interaction, emotion, and memory paradigms.  

3. AI \& Data Pipelines:
- Built 10+ end-to-end vision-, text-based and multi-modal workflows; developed modular pipelines for emotion recognition, text summarization, behavior analysis, and data synthesis using computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and prompt engineering.
