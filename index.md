## Currently
Independent Researcher (Seeking Postdoctoral Position)

Daejeon, Republic of Korea

## Research Statement

My research goal is to develop autonomous Al agents capable of systematic generalization and continual learning, drawing inspiration from the first principles of human cognition, I aim to achieve this by engineering a unified cognitive architecture that integrates two core components: an object-centric world model built from perception, and an adaptive metacognitive reasoning engine that guides deliberation. 

My unique foundation stems from a decade in comparative and computational cognitive neuroscience, providing the conceptual foundation, while my hands-on skills in computer vision and LLMs provide the technical means to bridge these fields and build truly intelligent systems.

### Research Interests

1.  **Adaptive Metacognitive Control (AMOC) for Reliable System 2 Reasoning:** 
Developing the AMOC architecture to dynamically regulate an agent's reasoning strategy. This involves designing an adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) router guided by an uncertainty-aware monitor, and enabling continual self-improvement via knowledge distillation.

2.  **Approximate Neuro-Symbolic World Models (ANSSP) for Systematic Generalization:** 
Building robust neuro-symbolic world models by developing a core engine (ANSSP) to parse perception. This project tackles the 'binding problem' by translating visual scenes into compositional symbolic representations to enhance OOD generalization.

3.  **Cognitive Architectures & First Principles of Intelligence:** 
Understanding the fundamental principles and architectural primitives that enable intelligence, whether natural or artificial. I aim to develop a first-principles understanding of how intelligent systems represent and process information to achieve general-purpose reasoning.

### Core Competencies

1.  **Neuro-Al & Cognitive Modeling:** 
Designing neuro-inspired cognitive architectures (e.g., System 2 via LLMs with CoT/ReAct) by analyzing and decoding neural (fMRI/EEG) and behavioral data.

2.  **Experimental Neuroscience:** 
Leading full experimental loops, from cognitive/behavioral paradigm design to targeted neural recording (e.g., single-unit recording), manipulation (e.g., optogenetics, chemogenetics, stereotaxic surgery) and analysis.

3.  **AI/ML Engineering:**
  - **Languages & Libraries:** Python (Advanced), PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Bash/Shell, LaTeX
  - **Models & Frameworks:** LLMs, RAG, LangChain, HuggingFace, Diffusion Models
  - **Environments & Tools:** Linux, SSH, Docker, Git, Anaconda, MLflow, Hydra, Weights & Biases
